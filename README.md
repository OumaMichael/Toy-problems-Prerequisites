### Toy-Problem Prerequisites
JavaScript Code Solutions Overview
This repository showcases a collection of JavaScript programs designed to solve various problems. These solutions demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as loops, array methods, conditional statements, and object-oriented programming. They also store key constants and parameters to ensure calculations are updated based on the latest requirements.

### Research Areas
This project includes the following JavaScript solutions:

Net Salary Calculator, Speed detector and Grading
Calculates an individual‚Äôs net salary on both monthly and annual bases.

Takes into account basic salary and benefits.

Computes deductions such as PAYE (progressive tax rates and reliefs), NSSF contributions, SHIF, and Housing Levy.

Bubble Sort
Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of numbers in ascending order.

Compares and swaps adjacent elements until the array is fully sorted.

Staircase Pattern
Logs a staircase pattern to the console, with each level represented by an increasing number of '#' characters.

Cylinder Volume Calculator
Uses an object class to calculate the volume of a cylinder using the formula 
ùëâ=ùúãùëü2‚Ñé.
Returns the volume rounded to four decimal places.

### Solutions
1. Net Salary Calculator, Speed detector and Grading
Description: Calculates monthly and annual net salary from a given basic salary and benefits, Speed detecting and Grading.

Key Concepts: Progressive taxation, storing constants, annual figures.

2. Bubble Sort
Description: Sorts an array of numbers in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Key Concepts: Loops, array manipulation, in-place sorting.

3. Staircase Pattern
Description: Prints a staircase pattern with a specified number of levels.

Key Concepts: Nested loops, string concatenation.

4. Cylinder Volume Calculator
Description: Calculates the volume of a cylinder using an object-oriented approach.

Key Concepts: Object classes, mathematical operations, numerical formatting.

### Usage Instructions
Environment
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

Running the Code
Save the code solutions in separate JavaScript files (e.g., .....js) or combine them into a single file.

Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Run the file using:

bash
node yourFileName.js
The console will display the output for each problem.

Customization
Modify input values (e.g., basic salary, benefits, array to sort, number of staircase levels, cylinder dimensions) as needed to test different scenarios.

### Research Areas
The solutions in this project leverage several core programming concepts and research areas:

Loops: Extensively used in sorting algorithms and pattern generation.

Array Methods: Demonstrated in Bubble Sort for iterating and manipulating arrays.

Conditional Statements: Employed in both the tax calculation and staircase pattern.

Object-Oriented Programming: Utilized in the Cylinder Volume Calculator via classes and constructors.

Memory Management: Constants and parameters are stored in variables to "remember" key values for calculations.
